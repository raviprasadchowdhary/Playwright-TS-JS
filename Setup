# Playwright Practice Application Setup

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (LTS version recommended)
- Git installed
- Visual Studio Code installed

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bondar-artem/pw-practice-app.git
```

### 2. Open in Visual Studio Code
- Navigate to the cloned directory
- Open the project folder in VSCode

### 3. Install Dependencies
Open the integrated terminal in VSCode and run:
```bash
npm install --force
```
**Note:** The `--force` flag is used to resolve any dependency conflicts.

### 4. Build and Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Access the Application
Once the build is complete, you can access the application locally at:
```
http://localhost:4200/
```

## Important Notes
- **Keep Terminal Running:** The terminal must remain active for the application to be available. If you close the terminal or press `CTRL+C`, the application will stop.
- **Restarting the Application:** If you need to restart, simply run `npm start` again in the terminal.


## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter installation errors, try deleting `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install --force` again
- Ensure port 4200 is not being used by another application
- Check that Node.js is properly installed by running `node --version` in terminal
